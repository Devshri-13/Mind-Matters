# Mind-Matters
Mind matters is our website-based initiative to raise awareness about the importance of mental health. It also provides motivational stories about people who have overcome mental health challenges. By bringing our effort to the next level, we hope to break this taboo and give people a new viewpoint on these concerns. MindMatters aims to provide information and resources to promote good mental health and offer support for those who are struggling.
